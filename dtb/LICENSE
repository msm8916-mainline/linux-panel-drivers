The device tree blobs (DTB) in this directory have been extracted from
an Android ROM (usually the stock Android installation provided by the vendor).
The firmware packages are usually proprietary. However, the device tree is
compiled from within the Linux kernel source, which is licensed under the
GNU General Public License version 2. Therefore, the binary compiled from it
should also be redistributable under the same license.

The source code for the binary files can be found on the websites of the vendors.
Most of the kernel sources are also archived at:
